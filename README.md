# Go CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Google Cloud Build

A production-ready example of a **Go web application** with a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Google Cloud Build**. This project demonstrates how to build, test, containerize, and deploy a Go app to Google Cloud, leveraging best practices for modern DevOps workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Go Application**

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/` ‚Äî Returns a welcome message.
  - `/health` ‚Äî Returns a JSON health status.

### 2. **Testing**

- Unit tests are defined in `main_test.go` and run automatically in CI.

### 3. **Containerization**

- Multi-stage Docker build for minimal, secure images.
- Uses `golang:1.21` for build, `gcr.io/distroless/static` for runtime.

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow**

- Triggers on push or PR to `main`.
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Set up Go environment
  3. Run unit tests
  4. Build and push Docker image to DockerHub (can be adapted for Artifact Registry)

#### **Google Cloud Build**

- Defined in `cloudbuild.yaml`.
- Builds and pushes the Docker image to Artifact Registry.
- Stores logs in a GCS bucket.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
    --iam-account=github-cicd-bot@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### 6. Trigger Manual Cloud Build (Optional)

```bash
gcloud builds submit --region=asia-south1 \
    --tag=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/go-app-repo/go-ci-cd-app:latest
```

### 7. (Optional) Set Default Project + Region

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set builds/region asia-south1
```

### 8. (Optional) Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy go-ci-cd-app \
    --image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/go-app-repo/go-ci-cd-app:latest \
    --region=asia-south1 \
    --platform=managed \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

## üìñ Project Walkthrough

This section provides a visual, step-by-step walkthrough of the entire CI/CD pipeline and deployment process, illustrating how the Go application moves from source code to a live, cloud-hosted service. Each stage is accompanied by real screenshots from the project.

### 1. Building the Docker Image Locally

Development begins with building the Docker image for the Go application on your local machine. This ensures the application runs as expected in a containerized environment before pushing to the cloud.

---

### 2. Running and Testing the Container Locally

After building the image, the container is run locally to verify that the application starts correctly and serves requests as intended.

![Container of the Image](screenshots/02-container-of-the-image.png)

You can see the server running and accessible on the specified port:

![Running Server](screenshots/03-running-server.png)

A health check endpoint (`/health`) is also tested to confirm the application is healthy:

---

### 3. Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and pushing Docker images. Every push or pull request to the `main` branch triggers the CI pipeline:

- Code is checked out
- Go environment is set up
- Unit tests are executed
- Docker image is built and pushed

Successful execution of the workflow is shown below:

You can also track the history and iterations of builds:

---

### 4. Cloud Build Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform

The `cloudbuild.yaml` file defines the steps for Google Cloud Build to build and push the Docker image to Artifact Registry. The configuration is managed directly in GCP:

![Cloud Build YAML in GCP](screenshots/07-cloudbuild-yaml-gcp.png)

Cloud Build triggers can be monitored, and detailed logs are available for each build:

![Logs of Cloud Build Triggers](screenshots/08-logs-of-cloudbuild-triggers.png)

---

### 5. Artifact Registry: Storing Docker Images

Once built, the Docker image is pushed to Google Artifact Registry, providing a secure and scalable storage solution for container images:

![Build Image in Artifact Registry Repo](screenshots/09-build-image-in-artifact-registry-repo.png)

---

### 6. Deployment to Cloud Run

The final step is deploying the containerized application to Google Cloud Run, enabling serverless, scalable hosting of the Go app. The deployment endpoint and status are shown below:

This visual walkthrough demonstrates the complete journey of your Go application, from local development and testing, through automated CI/CD, to secure, scalable deployment on Google Cloud Platform. Each screenshot provides evidence of the process and the robustness of the pipeline, making it easy for reviewers, recruiters, and collaborators to understand the technical depth and practical implementation of this project.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Here are some practical and easily integratable improvements you can consider for this project:

- **Automated Deployment to Cloud Run:**
  - Integrate Cloud Run deployment directly into the Cloud Build pipeline for true end-to-end automation.

- **Slack/Email Notifications:**
  - Add notifications for build and deployment status using Slack or email integrations in GitHub Actions or Cloud Build.

- **Branch-based Environments:**
  - Set up preview/staging environments for feature branches using separate Cloud Run services or tags.

- **Secret Management:**
  - Use Google Secret Manager or GitHub Secrets for managing sensitive environment variables and credentials.

- **Code Quality & Security Scans:**
  - Integrate tools like GoLint, GoSec, or SonarCloud into the CI pipeline for static code analysis and security checks.

- **Automated Rollbacks:**
  - Implement rollback strategies in Cloud Run or Cloud Build to revert to the previous version on failed deployments.

- **API Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Set up Google Cloud Monitoring and Alerting for uptime, latency, and error rate tracking.

- **Infrastructure as Code:**
  - Use Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager to manage GCP resources as code for reproducibility.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Add load testing (e.g., with k6 or Locust) as a CI step to ensure the app performs well under stress.

- **Multi-region Deployment:**
  - Deploy the application to multiple regions for higher availability and lower latency.

These enhancements can help make your CI/CD pipeline and deployment process even more robust, secure, and production-ready.
